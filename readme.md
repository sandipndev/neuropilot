NeuroPilot helps you stay focused and remember what you explore online.

When your mind starts to wander, it offers small, friendly nudges or short recall questions to bring you back. Over time, NeuroPilot builds a simple trail of your interests and learning progress - turning scattered browsing into a clear, connected journey of ideas.
